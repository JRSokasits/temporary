  <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Carnegie Mellon University established a coding boot camp program
        through a partnership with TechBridge in 2024.  All classes and
        materials are online, as well as live lecture sessions.  
    </p>
    <p>The first full time cohort began in September of that year with 
      daily online classes.  
    </p>    
    <p>The program was expanded in February 2025 with another full time 
        cohort and a new part time cohort.  The program is being expanded 
        further, with classes that concentrate on a single programming 
        language, beginning in the late summer of 2025.
